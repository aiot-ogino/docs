"Permissions live within a given scope. There are three scopes in the "

"A **context** is an instance of a scope. For example, a channel called "

"A team context has a parent system context and child channel contexts. "

msgid ""
"When determining whether a user is allowed to carry out a given action in"
" a given context, the union of the permissions of all roles that user has"
" been assigned in the current context and its parent contexts is "
"calculated. This enables permissions to cascade down the scope hierarchy."
" For example, if a users is granted the "
"``manage_public_channel_properties`` permission in a role in the system "
"context, then the user has permissions to manage public channel "
"properties in all channels, in all teams, of which they are a member."

"Schemes describe the default roles applied to users in a context, and all"
" child contexts. Schemes are either defined specifically for a context, "
"or if they are not specified, the relevant parts of the parent context’s "
"scheme are applied, ultimately climbing the hierarchy to the System "
"Scheme, which serves the purpose of providing the system-wide defaults. "
"For example, if Team A does not have a team-scoped scheme defined, the "
"System Scheme will provide the defaults for all contexts in Team A."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/permissions-backend.rst:53
