"Mattermost can be configured to act as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider. The "
"SAML Single-Sign-On integration offers the following benefits:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:7
msgid ""
"**Single-sign-on.** Users can sign-in to Mattermost with their SAML "
"credentials."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:8
msgid ""
"**Centralized identity management.** Mattermost accounts automatically "
"pull user attributes from SAML upon login, such as full name, email and "
"username."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:9
msgid ""
"**Automatic account provisioning.** New Mattermost user accounts are "
"automatically created the first time a user signs in with their SAML "
"credentials on the Mattermost server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:11
msgid ""
"SAML Single-Sign-On itself does not support periodic updates of user "
"attributes nor automatic deprovisioning. However, SAML with AD/LDAP sync "
"can be configured to support these use cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:13
msgid ""
"For more information about SAML, see `this article from Varonis "
"<https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-saml/>`_, and `this conceptual "
"example from DUO <https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-"

"Mattermost officially supports Okta, OneLogin and Microsoft ADFS as the "
"identity providers (IDPs), please see links below for more details on how"
" to configure SAML with these providers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:25
msgid ""
"In addition to the officially supported identity providers, you can also "
"configure SAML for a custom IdP. For instance, customers have "
"successfully set up Azure AD, DUO, PingFederate and SimpleSAMLphp as a "
"custom IdPs. You can also set up MFA on top of your SAML provider for "
"additional security."

msgid ""
"In Mattermost v5.14, you can optionally configure Mattermost to sign the "
"SAML request using a private key to meet InfoSec requirements at your "
"organization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:32
msgid ""
"In future roadmap, the main consideration is an integration with SCIM, "
"via plugin. Such an integration allows system administrators to create "
"SAML provisioned users before their first login, and sync them against "
"Mattermost permissions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deployment/sso-saml.rst:34
msgid ""
"Currently user provisioning and deprovisioning can be handled with SAML "
"sync, but relies on AD/LDAP - SCIM enables admins to control user "
"provisioning and deprovisioning within the IdP itself."
