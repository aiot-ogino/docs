"Using image proxies means that users make only secure requests. By "
"allowing image requests to go straight to third-party servers, tracking "
"pixels is allowed. Users can put invisible images in posts that logs time"
" and location data for every user that views the post. An image proxy "
"protects user privacy by eliminating this direct interaction with third-"
"party servers."
